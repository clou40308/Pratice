			Mickey has been through many design changes from 1928. In his first cartoon Plane Crazy, Mickey had
			no gloves or shoes and his eyes were large black ovals. He first wore gloves when he sat down to
			play piano in the Opry House and by 1939 in The Pointer Mickey was shown with a pupil.

		<p>
			Minnie was designed in the fashion of a fashion girl and created to be the lover of Mickey Mouse.
			Although she always appears in red, she was originally designed to have a blue and green outfit. In
			the 1929 cartoon The Karnival Kid it was also revealed that she wears black stockings.

		<p>
			Goofy made his first appearance in the 1932 classic, Mickey’s Revue. He’s had some name changes over
			the years, being called Dippy Dawg and Dippy the Goof before becoming known simply as Goofy, one of
			Mickey’s hilarious pals that we have all come to know and love. Garsh!

		<p>
			Donald was first seen in The Wise Little Hen back in 1934. He was a big hit with audiences and his
			popularity continued to increase until he eventually starred in 128 cartoons and appeared in over
			150 theatrical films! That’s more than any other Disney character, even Mickey!
